### Git Diff Review

#### File: `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/com/qx/middleware/sdk/OpenAiCodeReview.java`

#### Changes:
- The `OpenAiCodeReview` class has been modified in line 222, where the constructor of `ChatGLM` is being called with a different environment variable name for the API key.

#### Detailed Review:

1. **Environment Variable Name Change**:
   - The original environment variable name used to pass the API key to the `ChatGLM` constructor was `"CHATGLM_API_KEY_SECRET"`.
   - The modified code uses `"CHATGLM_APIKEYSECRET"` as the environment variable name.
   - **Analysis**: The change in the environment variable name might be due to a typo or a deliberate renaming. If it is a typo, it should be corrected back to `"CHATGLM_API_KEY_SECRET"`. If it is a deliberate change, it should be reviewed to ensure that this is the intended behavior and that any other part of the code that relies on this environment variable has been updated accordingly.

2. **Potential Impact**:
   - If this is a typo, it could lead to the application failing to authenticate with the ChatGLM API, as the correct API key would not be provided.
   - If this is a deliberate change, there should be a corresponding update in the documentation to reflect this change, and any other parts of the code that might expect the old environment variable name should be updated to the new one.

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Environment variable names should be consistent and easy to understand. The change from `"CHATGLM_API_KEY_SECRET"` to `"CHATGLM_APIKEYSECRET"` could be confusing, especially if the rest of the code or documentation uses the original format.
   - If renaming an environment variable, it is good practice to add comments or documentation explaining the change, especially if it is a breaking change.

#### Recommendations:
- Verify whether the change is intentional and if it aligns with the expected behavior of the application.
- If it is a typo, revert the change to `"CHATGLM_API_KEY_SECRET"`.
- If it is deliberate, ensure that all references to the environment variable are updated throughout the codebase and that documentation is updated to reflect the new name.
- Consider adding a unit test to ensure that the `ChatGLM` class correctly handles the environment variable, regardless of its name.
